# College Database

A database program created in MySQL that can function as a college database. It stores all the students' info in the student_info table which contains the firstname, lastname, student ID, major and their sex. The instructors' details with their IDs and names are in another related table. Another table contains the major names and their corresponding codes. Lastly, different tables have been created for each individual course being offered. These course tables contain the student ID of each student who has taken the course, name of professor who taught the course to the student, year and semester the course was taken in and the mark the student received in the course.
